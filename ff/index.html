Gilgamesh, where are you hurrying to? You will never find that life for which you are
looking. When the gods created man they allotted to him death, but life they retained in their own keeping. As
for you, Gilgamesh, fill your belly with good things; day and night, night and day, dance and be merry, feast
and rejoice. Let your clothes be fresh, bathe yourself in water, cherish the little child that holds your hand, and
make your wife happy in your embrace; for this too is the lot of man.
