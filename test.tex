I WILL proclaim to the world the deeds of Gilgamesh. This was the man to whom
all things were known; this was the king who knew the countries of the world. He was
wise, lie saw mysteries and knew secret things, he brought us a tale of the days
before the flood. He went on a long journey, was weary, worn-out with labour,
returning he rested, he engraved on a stone the whole story.
